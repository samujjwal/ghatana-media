# Surface: `launcher`

Canonical Media runtime composition and distribution (`launcher`,
Java/Gradle). `MediaRuntime` is the single composed runtime: versioned
upload, identity, rights, provider-attempt fencing, reconcile-after-crash
and stable terminal reads — **no second writer**.

## Responsibility

- `MediaRuntime.compose(environment)` builds the runtime from `MEDIA_*`
  settings; `MediaRuntime` implements `MediaProcessingRuntimePort` and
  owns upload sessions (`beginUpload`/`appendChunk`/`completeUpload`),
  artifact reads, `processingReady`, `resolveSourceAuthorization` and
  `copyArtifactContent`.
- `MediaHttpHandler` + `MediaRouteManifest` + `MediaSecurityFilter` +
  `MediaErrorCode` serve the admitted HTTP surface with the canonical
  route manifest and typed error taxonomy. The controller takes tenant and
  subject only from the server-side authenticated principal: verified Shared
  JWT claims or the configured bootstrap service identity. Caller-supplied
  `X-Principal-Id` is discarded; a local development identity is synthetic
  and cannot select a user principal.
- Accepted job submissions and stream-frame acknowledgements expose canonical
  `Location` status links plus `Retry-After: 1`; the retry hint means poll the
  exact job/session read route and is not a completion claim. Job reads can
  include `requestId` to require exact submission identity during reconciliation.
- Supporting runtimes compose consent administration, caption
  registration/parent-clock, lifecycle publication, privacy maintenance,
  semantic redaction, production-run coordination and canonical stream
  frame port — each behind its own admission checks.
- `MediaLauncher` is the process entrypoint; `MediaRuntimeConfig` and
  `LocalMediaRuntimeSupport` hold configuration/support wiring;
  `ComposedMediaRuntimePortFactory` is the ServiceLoader registration
  shared with the standalone `vision-service` entrypoint;
  `MediaSubmissionDigest` supplies submission identity.

## Public operations

| Entry point | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `MediaLauncher.main` | Process start (`bin/launcher` in the install dist) |
| `MediaRuntime.compose` / upload & artifact methods | Canonical runtime port |
| `MediaHttpHandler` | HTTP request handling over `MediaRouteManifest` |
| `vision-service` (`bin/vision-service`) | Standalone Vision gRPC server on the same packaged classpath |

## States and invariants

- One active writer: the runtime owns job/attempt state; legacy binaries
  may remain the sole active writer until verified M08 cutover — never
  run a second writer against the same state.
- Fail-closed admission: missing factory/runtime/rights or DI admission
  denies rather than degrades. The current scene-text source does not
  admit DI pixel dispatch (no external-processing consent revalidation
  or trusted boundary/region/retention binding); OCR requests stay
  denied. Frame source handles still images only — video-frame OCR is
  unqualified.
- External job submission requires an exact immutable source version and
  current source-owner/Shared-policy evidence bound to the authenticated
  principal, operation, purpose, provider version, region, and retention.
  Rights and consent are checked before job creation, again at the provider
  effect boundary, and before bounded source bytes are exposed. Missing,
  stale, mismatched, revoked, or biometric/retention-disallowed authorization
  produces a typed pre-dispatch denial with no job or provider effect.
- Production-plan fingerprints include tenant/project/origin identity
  with length-framed inputs; earlier fingerprints change — existing
  records must be reconciled against original inputs, never rewritten.
- The H-02 DAG places its manual rights-review gate before capture; the
  H-07 step coordinator does not yet enforce DAG dependencies — callers
  must not dispatch children of skipped/unresolved gates. A durable
  dependency-aware production executor is still required.

## Dependencies and configuration

- `MEDIA_*` environment configuration for the runtime; `VISION_CAPABILITY_PROFILE`
  + `DI_*` endpoint/provider/model settings for the DI consumer path.
  Distribution: `./gradlew :services:media:launcher:installDist`.

## Errors

`MediaErrorCode` typed taxonomy over HTTP; admission denials are explicit
(`NOT_ADMITTED`-class), never silent fallbacks.
Inbound JSON uses strict duplicate-member detection, so ambiguous fields such
as repeated tenant identity are rejected before upload persistence.
Dynamic HTTP path identifiers also reject malformed percent-encoded UTF-8
before resource lookup, so replacement decoding cannot alias a job identity.
Provider-profile poll failures use poll-start time when invalidating metrics;
an older slow failure preserves a newer published observation.

## Tests and commands

```bash
./gradlew :services:media:launcher:test
./gradlew :services:media:launcher:installDist
```

Executable completion targets (plan §07): J01/J02/J20/J03 integration,
process-kill before/after commit, stale tenant, idempotency,
cancel/late response, startup readiness, bounded threads and memory.
Focused identity and rights coverage:

```bash
./gradlew :services:media:launcher:test \
  --tests 'com.ghatana.media.launcher.MediaSecurityFilterTest' \
  --tests 'com.ghatana.media.launcher.MediaRuntimeSpeechAdmissionTest' \
  --tests 'com.ghatana.media.launcher.MediaRuntimeJobGovernanceTest' \
  -Pghatana.media.compositeScope=FOCUSED -Pghatana.media.focusedModules=launcher
```
